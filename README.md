## Overview
PomoDo is a productivity tool that helps you manage your time efficiently using the Pomodoro Technique. It allows you to break your work or study sessions into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique is designed to enhance focus, productivity, and time management.

## Why
Currently, I believe that there is no good-looking, simple Pomodoro timer app that works with WearOS. Most have features that I personally am not into such as tracking all your sessions, setting up individual tasks, etc. I believe that these features take away from the central focus of a Pomodoro, focus and time management. Therefore, my goal with this app to create a simple and pleasing user interface Pomodoro app.
