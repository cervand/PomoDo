## üëâ Overview
PomoDo is a productivity tool that is currently in development that helps you manage your time efficiently using the Pomodoro Technique. It allows you to break your work or study sessions into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique is designed to enhance focus, productivity, and time management.

PomoDo is currently in development. My plan is to develop all of the backend first, and then once it is done, I will begin with the frontend. 

## ü§î Why
Currently, I believe that there is no good-looking, simple Pomodoro timer app that works with WearOS. Most have features that I personally am not into such as tracking all your sessions, setting up individual tasks, etc. I believe that these features take away from the central focus of a Pomodoro, focus and time management. Therefore, my goal with this app to create a simple and pleasing user interface Pomodoro. I also wanted to learn Kotlin and Android app development so I decided that building a basic app was the best course of action.

Because I am completely new to Android development, I decided to "practice" by building the Pomodoro app for an Android device instead of a WearOS device. The endgoal is to connect my Android Pomodo app to its WearOS app and publish to the Play Store.

## üöÄ Features 
- Set customizable work and break durations
- Start, pause, and reset the timer as needed
- Receive visual and audio notifications, including ticking during break or working/study time.
- Material Design 3 theming

## üõ† Technologies Used
- Kotlin

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap (Currently in development)
- Add the ability to change your work length, break length, work sessions, and long break length in a new window.
- Add bells to separate each timer section.
- Add ticking for working/break with the option to disable it.
- Implement rich notifications to be able to control the timer when not currently in app screen.
- Implement Material Design 3 user interface.
- Test app on multiple Android devices and configurations
- Publish to Play Store
- Begin WearOS Pomodo Development.

## üì≤ Current Progress
Currently, I am able to start a Pomodoro and stop it, as well as show the current time in a TextView. As mentioned earlier, I want to develop the backend first, and then the frontend. That said, the current UI is simply for testing and development purposes. The endgoal for its UI is below as a Figma  design.
